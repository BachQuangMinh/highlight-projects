# Learning Logistic Regression

Hi there,

This is just a little experiment when I learn about Logistic Regression. I thought it would be nice to test it out with something practical. 

So the problem is, given cell features of a lot of cells, build a model to predict if the cell is 'benign' or 'malignant'. 

I realized that although the model has high accuracy, but actually it only predicting on the majority class.

Next step of learning is 'how to improve a model performance when classes are unequal?'
