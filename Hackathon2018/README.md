# Hackathon 2018 at John Von Neumann

Hi there,

This is where you can find my attempts at the Hackathon 2018 at John Von Neumann Institute, together with my two dear friends, Le Thach and Quang Nguyen (who is my co-worker at the time I write this readme)

This was such an exciting moment during the time being a Master student at JVN institute.

I would like to give my big thank to my friends who have been supporting me through this intensive projects and a giant thank to JVN for hosting the event, giving us the opportunity to apply learning to real life problems.

And our team earned 1st price for the round 1 and 2nd price for round 2. 

Not too bad for a non-tech guy like me!
