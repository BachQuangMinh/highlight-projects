# Airbnb Internship Project Application

Hi there,

In this project, I was given a sample data set from Airbnb when applying to an agile startup called Kyanon.

Since the data set is publicly shared on the website, copy rights are guaranteed.

[Here](<https://kyanon.digital/>) is the website of the company. 

## Requirements

From the data set, use any visualization tool to draw insights.

## Initial thoughts

With a could-not-be-shorter requirement, I thought of making some hypotheses myself in order to drive my analysis. 

In the `report.pdf`, I presented 4 hypotheses that I called 'questions'.

Question 1:  How does the price distribute by Neighbourhood, Property Type and Room Type? 

Question 2:  Is there a relationship between the factors Neighbourhood, Property Type, Room Type and the price? If so, which factor has the most impact on the price? 

Question 3: Which sector is offering good service?, which mean earning high review scores

Question 4:  An attempt to build a predictive model for review score using Neighbourhood, Property Type, Room Type and Price.

Details methods and analysis can be found in my report. The *.py files contains python code that I used to create graphs, tables and models for the report
