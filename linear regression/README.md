# Get rich with Linear Regression! ... not really 

Hi there,

This is just a little experiment when I learn about linear regression. I thought it would be nice to test it out with something practical. 

So the problem is, given stock price data in the past, use linear regression to build a model to predict stock price in the future (one day in the future or ten days in the future).

I follow closely this [tutorial](<https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/>), but added in my wonders and my personal learning notes.
