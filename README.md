# My Journey to Data Science

Hi there,

Welcome to my repository!

This is where I save most of my highlight projects on the journey of transitioning to Data Science. The projects reflect my learning and they are my sandboxes to get my hand dirty with practical experience. 

You are more than welcome to be come a contributor to this repository and offer me feedback of my projects.

Thanks for checking it out,

Minh
